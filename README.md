🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodeBuild — From Idea to Automation

This project is part of my journey from Felon2Cloud — where I’m proving that dedication, self-learning, and grit can turn any background into a cloud engineering success story.

I built this repository to demonstrate end-to-end CI/CD automation using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and Terraform — the same tools used by top DevOps teams to deploy code reliably and securely.

🧠 What This Project Does

This repo sets up a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that:

Automatically builds and tests code every time it’s pushed to GitHub.

Deploys infrastructure and applications using Terraform and AWS CodeBuild.

Keeps the entire system modular, scalable, and production-ready.

I wanted to show that I can not only write code — but also automate how it moves from developer to deployment.

⚙️ Tech Stack

AWS CodePipeline – Orchestrates the entire flow

AWS CodeBuild – Builds, tests, and packages artifacts

Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

GitHub – Source control and pipeline trigger

Bash Scripts – Local automation for validation and build steps

🔧 How to Use

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/charles-bucher/ci-cd-pipeline-with-codebuild.git
cd ci-cd-pipeline-with-codebuild


Initialize Terraform:

terraform init
terraform apply


Push your code to trigger the AWS CodePipeline and watch it deploy automatically.

💡 What I Learned

How to design and deploy a real-world CI/CD pipeline from scratch.

How to manage AWS IAM roles, permissions, and CodeBuild artifacts.

The importance of clean automation, infrastructure versioning, and error handling.

That persistence beats perfection — every time.

🔥 Why This Matters

I’m building a portfolio of real, working cloud projects to prove one thing:

You don’t need a perfect past to build a powerful future.

This project represents my technical growth, consistency, and commitment to mastering Cloud Engineering.
