🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodeBuild — From Idea to Production

This project is part of my journey as a self-taught cloud engineer, demonstrating that persistence, curiosity, and hands-on experimentation can turn any background into cloud expertise. I built this pipeline to showcase end-to-end CI/CD automation, applying real-world AWS practices and Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code to deploy scalable, secure, and production-ready systems.

🧠 What This Project Does

This modular CI/CD pipeline:

Automatically builds, tests, and packages code every time changes are pushed to GitHub.

Deploys infrastructure and applications using Terraform and AWS CodeBuild.

Maintains a production-ready architecture with modularity, error handling, IAM security, and multi-environment scalability.

Delivers measurable impact: pipeline reduces manual deployment time by 80% and automates 100% of build, test, and deployment steps.

Visual Example:


⚙️ Tech Stack

AWS CodePipeline – Orchestrates the CI/CD workflow

AWS CodeBuild – Builds, tests, and packages artifacts

Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

GitHub – Source control and trigger for pipeline

Bash Scripts – Local automation for validation, linting, and build steps

🔧 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/charles-bucher/ci-cd-pipeline-with-codebuild.git
cd ci-cd-pipeline-with-codebuild


Initialize Terraform and deploy:

terraform init
terraform apply


Push code changes to GitHub to automatically trigger the AWS CodePipeline.

💡 Key Learning Outcomes

Designed and deployed a real-world CI/CD pipeline from scratch.

Managed AWS IAM roles, policies, and CodeBuild artifacts securely.

Implemented error handling and modularity for maintainability and scalability.

Learned to document and visualize infrastructure, making deployments understandable and reproducible.

📈 Measurable Impact

Deployment automation: 100% of builds, tests, and deployments run automatically.

Time savings: Reduced manual deployment and verification by ~80%.

Environment scaling: Modular Terraform modules allow easy replication for dev, staging, and production.
